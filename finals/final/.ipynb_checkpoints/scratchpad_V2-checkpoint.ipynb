    "##### Overview\n",
    "**[TODO]**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Descriptive Analysis\n",
    "Get a rough overview of the targets using the following code...  \n",
    "Seems to be a mix of NANs, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0  \n",
    "\n",
    "Rough overview of images   \n",
    "The data you have is in the form of a NumPy array with shape (2911, 3, 16, 16), which suggests that you have 2911 samples, each with a 3-channel image of size 16x16 pixels. (Taken from CHATGPT)  \n",
    "\n",
    "asdf\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Detection and Handling of Missing Values\n",
    "For Images:  \n",
    "Presence of 21913 NAN values out of 2235648 values gives a NAN rate of 0.980%  \n",
    "3 channel 16 x 16 dataset means one layer for RGB values - it doesnt seem feasible to drop all rows that have at least one NAN value inside so I will interpolate it instead - I will use pandas' interpolate method with the 'nearest setting' since a quick glance at the images dont seem to be anything visibily recognisable, so I will just choose a fast a simple method to plug the NAN values with a value that can be used instead.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It also seems that some values are strings - I will convert them in this step as well since interpolate requires numeric.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even after interpolation, there still is NAN values - I'll fill them up manually with its median value. Initially I used mean, but it seems to give 'inf' as the mean - probably overflow in calculations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "For Targets:  \n",
    "Presence of 291 NAN values of out 2911 total rows gives a NAN rate of 10%  \n",
    "10% seems significant - so I will convert it into a class of its own instead of dropping it   \n",
    "Seems like the targets class only has 3 unique values - upon inspection it should be (0.0, 1.0, 2.0), so I will define NAN to be of class 3.0  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Detection and Handling of Outliers\n",
    "For Images:  \n",
    "A quick look shows that some pixels are out of the 0 - 256 range and are in the 1000s or even negative - which is of course not possible. I can either scale/normalise everything down to a 0-256 range, but instead I will simply cap the values that are less than 0 to be 0, and values which exceed 256 to be 256.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For Targets:\n",
    "I have already checked that the targets have 4 unique classes - so there are no outliers here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Detection and Handling of Class Imbalance \n",
    "For Images:  \n",
    "I want to know the proportions of the 4 unique classes - I know that they are nominal but I will convert them to categorical instead at a later stage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The breakdown is as follows:  \n",
    "0.0 - 82.2%  \n",
    "4.0 - 10%  \n",
    "1.0 - 7%  \n",
    "2.0 - 0.85%  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the breakdowns are very skewed, I dont think its a good idea to do oversampling or undersampling in this case because I will be extrapolating the data too much when I generate synthetic samples - if the breakdowns were less skewed this approach would be better in my opinion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to use weighted_loss, so I give more importance to minority class samples when I generate my model, and dont do anything here.    \n",
    "\n",
    "For Targets:  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.5 Merging Image Data and Labels into one Dataset\n",
    "I will merge the image data and labels into one combined dataframe - while this process should automatically remove any rows, I dont expect any rows to be removed since we did not remove any rows in the data processing thus far.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Confirmed - remains at a total of 2911 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pre 5. Convert Labels data into categorical  \n",
    "I will not convert the labels from numerical into categorical since my model requires a numerical output, but in principle these outputs should represent distinct categories.   \n",
    "\n",
    "I also converted the column name from '0' to 'target' for sanity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Understanding Relationship Between Variables\n",
    "Nil - I will skip this part because part of understanding relationships between Variables involves plotting them out for a better picture.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. Data Visualization\n",
    "There are several methods that I will choose to employ to try to find some relationship between the variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [SCRAPED - reason too many datapoints, plot is not clear even after magnification] Correlation Analysis with Heatmap.  \n",
    "I will use seaborn and matplotlib on my local to plot out the heatmap\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [SCRAPED - reason too many datapoints, plot is not clear even after magnification] Distribution Plots.  \n",
    "I want to see the distributions of the features per categorical label  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, I was given the warning that \"Dataset has 0 variance; skipping density estimate\" when running 2 - looping through each pixel one by one and plotting that against the categorical datas, which might suggest that each pixel does not vary enough for there to be a clear indication.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Image Visualisation.  \n",
    "View a few images for each label to try to find a pattern via visual inspection.  \n",
    "No clear pattern to distinguish between A,B,C,D.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. PCA.  \n",
    "Condense the data into just a few core features and plot the data.  \n",
    "Doesn't work for 2,3,4 variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion - There is no clear patterns in the data when we look at the image as a whole.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 7. General Preprocessing\n",
    "Mostly nil since much of the preprocssing has been integrally done over the past few steps. I'll use this section to just to a sanity check of my data one last time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Seems all good to me.  \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "##### 8. Feature Selection \n",
    "We have way too many features - 768 pixels (3 x 16 x 16), so we will use RFE. Initially I wanted to try PCA, but PCA on the images do not show any clear distinctions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ok gonna try PCA since RFE is taking too long computationally - we will try for 4 principle components.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 9. Feature Engineering\n",
    "Here I want to map the features to a polynominal function of degree 2, thereby generating more components out from the 4 principle components that we have derived after applying PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 9.5 Split Data into Train and Test Data  \n",
    "I will manually split the data into train and test data - 0.8 for train and 0.2 for test.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pre 10. Preparing the Data to the right format\n",
    "I need to convert the data from pandas dataframe to a pytorch tensor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll try using torch's dataloader function  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 10. Creating Models\n",
    "Here I start with a very simple CNN model:  \n",
    "1 conv layer using relu + pooling  \n",
    "1 conv layer using relu + pooling  \n",
    "1 linear layer + relu  \n",
    "\n",
    "In total I expect 14 input features with 4 output target classes for classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 10.5 Model Prediction\n",
    "I will need to do some data manipulation since I applied PCA and feature scaling on the train data - the same needs to be done for the test data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 11. Model Evaluation\n",
    "Simply run the loss and accuracy for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model_v1 - F1: 0.22\n",
    "1 conv layer using relu + pooling  \n",

    "Model_v2 - F1: 0.23\n",
    "6 conv layers using relu + pooling\n",
    "dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "I suspect that feature scaling is causing overfitting, and that 4 PCAs are not enough - lets try 10 PCAs without feature scaling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Model_v1_1 - F1: 0.25\n",
    "Model_v2_1 - F1: 0.39\n",
    "\n",
    "Try PCA 20 for Model_v2- F1: 0.24\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm gona try to just trial and error the sweet spot for PCAs for Model_v2 - no avail for PCA=4 to PCA=20, best is PCA=10 at F1=0.39\n",
